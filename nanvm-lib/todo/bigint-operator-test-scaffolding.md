## bigint-operator-test-scaffolding. Shared test helpers for the bigint operator modules

**Priority:** P4
**Status:** open

### Problem

Every bigint operator file redeclares the same inline unit-test scaffolding
in `nanvm-lib/src/vm/bigint/`:

- `type T = BigInt<Naive>` + `fn int(value: i64) -> T { value.into() }` —
  duplicated in `add.rs:19-23`, `sub.rs:19-23`, `mul.rs:53-57`.
- `type T` + `fn pos(items: Vec<u64>) -> T` / `fn neg(items: Vec<u64>) -> T`
  (both `T::unchecked_new(...)`) — duplicated in `shl.rs:68-79` and
  `shr.rs:45-57`.
- `mod.rs:229` uses a parallel `type TestBigInt = BigInt<Naive>`.

The identical comment
`// TODO: The unit tests should not use \`naive\` or other VM implementations.
//       We should move these tests into integration tests.` is itself
copy-pasted at `add.rs:13`, `sub.rs:13`, `mul.rs:47` (and as
`// TODO: move these tests to integration tests.` at `mod.rs:221`) — a
known-but-unfiled task living as four comment clones.

### Proposal

Primary plan: a `#[cfg(test)] mod test_util` under `vm/bigint/` exporting
`T`/`int`/`pos`/`neg`, imported by each operator's `tests` module; the four
TODO comment clones collapse to one at the shared module.

The copy-pasted TODO's wish — move these tests to integration tests
(`nanvm-lib/tests/`) — cannot simply own these helpers: integration tests
compile as an external crate, and `pos`/`neg` are built on
`BigInt::unchecked_new`, which is private (`nanvm-lib/src/vm/bigint/mod.rs:51`)
— deliberately, since it can construct non-normalized values. Moving the
`unchecked_new`-based tests out therefore requires either widening that
constructor's visibility just for tests (a bad trade) or rebuilding the raw
multi-word operands through public API. Tests that only need `int` (public
`From<i64>`) can move; the `pos`/`neg` internal-representation tests should
stay in-crate with the shared helper. If the integration-test move is still
wanted for the rest, that partial split rides on top of this consolidation.

Either way, delete the per-file comment clones.

### Tasks

- [ ] Add `#[cfg(test)] mod test_util` with `T`/`int`/`pos`/`neg`; migrate
      the operator `tests` modules and `mod.rs`'s `TestBigInt` to it.
- [ ] Remove the duplicated TODO comments, keeping one at the shared module
      (re-scoped to the `From<i64>`-only tests that *can* move out).
- [ ] `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt -- --check`.

  — cross-language (JS proof vs Rust test) duplication; this issue is the
  intra-Rust helper duplication, a different site and mechanism.
