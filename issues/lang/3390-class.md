# Classes

Classes are [nominal types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system). In other words, their definitions are location-based, not content-based. This can cause many problems, such as duplicate incompatible class definitions during serialization and code importing. So, the best way to use classes would be to use CA VM.
