# Classes

Classes are [nominal types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system). In other words, their definitions are location based, not content based. It can cause a lot of problem such as duplicate incompatible definitions of classes during serialization and code importing. So the best way to use classes would be to use CA VM.
